### After

In today's time [CSS](https://css-tricks.com) is the accepted way of doing things because it is a stylesheet language and far more powerful than HTML.

Peter Flynn (html5doctor.com) summed it up nice: 

> Before `<style>` elements, The idea of styles was foreign to HTML, but by switching off styling on the browser (i.e., using `?stylesheettype=text/css`) you could still read the content of the HTML document. There was only one stylesheet per document, whereas now there can be many (and you can change the stylesheet for a document using scripting). In addition, CSS stylesheets arenâ€™t as well-known as HTML and as a result, are harder to learn/master.
