### Tracking issues

**Github** allows you to track work across multiple branches in a single repository with **Issues**. You can use the **issues** to create multiple to do lists or you can use them to track different pieces of work across different branches. The person who brings up an issue is the person who writes the first comment on an issue.

If an **Issue** is found in one branch you would branch out of the branch that it was found and fix the problem. Once that is done you can close the **Issue** on **GitHub**.

1. To view **Issues** click on the **Issues** tab just below **Pull Requests**.
