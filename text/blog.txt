Monty Python's Holy Grail is one of the silliest movies of all time. It's a comedy classic that is loved by millions, but it is also undeniably stupid.

The movie follows the quest of King Arthur and his knights of the round table as they search for the Holy Grail. They face many obstacles along the way, including a bridge guarded by a troll, a French knight who is extremely rude, and a group of rabbits who attack them with deadly force.

Despite its silliness, Monty Python's Holy Grail is a hilarious movie that is sure to make you laugh. If you're looking for a good laugh, this is the movie for you.
